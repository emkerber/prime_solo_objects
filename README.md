# prime_solo_objects

This was an assignment from Prime Digital Academy, assigned on 06/24/2016. The instructions were to pick our favorite team and make them into an object in JavaScript. The object needed to have at least 10 properties. After making the object we were to write a function that pretty prints the values within the object. Students who wanted to add more to the assignment could include a getter for one or more of the properties.
